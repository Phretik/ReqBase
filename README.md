# ReqBase
A web app for my software engineering and agile module

This is a web app that is designed to be relevant to my current job role. Applications packaging.
Reqbase is a web app that allows users to log on, register requests they have received for packaged apps and update their team with a team log that they can use to update their team and log their progress and activities.

Their are 2 users created:
1) Email: Admin@admin.com    password: password
2) Email: Test@test.com      password: password

User 1 is of course an admin account, however the second and all subsequent users will be standard accounts
